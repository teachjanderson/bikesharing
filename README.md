# Overview and Purpose #

This analysis is available via Tableau [Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.anderson5061/viz/BikeDataChallengeStory/CitiBikiStory?publish=yes).

In New York City, Bike-sharing is a popular form of transportation for leisure and work. In an effort to expand, the company CitiBike looks towards Des Moines. To better understand the success in New York, the analysis identified trends, successes, and potential modifications in opening in a new location. Specifically, this includes the number of riders, by gender and usertype, throughout the week. 

# Results #

***Trip Duration***

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/teachjanderson/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Duration.png" width="600" />

As seen in the graph, the majority of Citibikes are used during trips of less than 20 minutes. The greatest number of trips are used for 10 minutes and this supports a high volume of use of both leisure and travel for work within city limits. 

***Trip Duration by Gender***

When these trips are analyzed by gender, Citibikes are predominantly used by males and fall in that 10-20 minute time range. Further analysis of the discrepancy for male vs female use is worth investigation.  

***Use by Gender Throughout the Week and Hour***

The time frames around work (8-9am and 5-6pm) show the most use by males and females throughout the week as seen in the analysis. Saturday shows a steady use throughout the late morning to evening. Wednesday shows a drop in use that is then picked back up on Thursday and Friday. 

***Weekday Use by Gender***

Similar to the trip duration analysis, males subscribers make up the most use throughout the week in comparison to customers and female subscribers. Thursday and Friday reveal the most use throughout the week. This is further compared in the graph below which shows overall totals by day.

Analyzing bike use revealed the majority is within Manhattan and scattered into various clusters throughout the city. Further analysis is recommended to investigate the connection between starting and stopping points along with cross examining demographics and other variables which may influence bike use. 


# Summary #

The analysis of Citibike's data reveals a few helpful insights as Citibike prepares for development in Des Moines. Males make up the most use of Citibikes. Identifying reasons, advantages and disadvantages, and developing strategies to increase female representation is recommended. 

Further analysis of Station IDs revealed clusters of Citibike use. Cluster 6 includes 15 stations while Cluster 1 includes 113. Stations in cluster 6 average 12,000 users compared to those in Cluster 1 which average 6000 users. Further analysis on the various stations and what factors into greater use is recommended as future stations are identified.
